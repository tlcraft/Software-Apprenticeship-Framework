# Software Apprenticeship Framework

I've become very interested in Software Apprenticeship programs and what these teach people. Some programs are developed to help new hires get up to speed at a particular company. Others are designed to take your programming skills to the next level. This may sound similar to a coding boot camp however instead of focusing on a particular language or framework as some programs do these apprenticeship programs go wider than that and bring in multiple languages, lots of reading, a teaching component, and mentoring. This repo will be a collection of relevant articles concerning Software Apprenticeships and will grow into an "open source apprenticeship program" with time. The majority of this file lists lots of topics within the software development world with links to articles which provide more detail.

I'm interested in growing as an engineer and this type of program has shown me a framework to follow in order to do just that. While I'm doing this for myself so that I can continue to learn anyone who reaches this page can also follow along and hopefully find new topics to dive into. Since learning of "Software Craftsmanship" in the fall of 2017 I started organizing craftsmanship lunches twice a week at work to bring people together for continuous learning. I also started a "Software Crafters" Meetup group in my local community in the spring of 2018. Along with that I started the first freeCodeCamp group in my community as well. These all help everyone involved grow as software professionals, from those whom I work with, to the larger community, to myself individually. Thus begins my journey into the software crafter philosophy.

Ultimately I think you only need to do one thing and that is: practice continuous lifelong learning. Commit to spending time several hours a week or more to learning something new or practicing. In time you'll pick up a lot of things and start connecting the dots among many disparate ideas. Stay true to fundamental things, for example in our context of software, writing tests and building things to be extensible and reusable. If one has a solid fundamental base and is always learning I don't think you can go wrong with that. 

If you do work through the topics listed below, while you won't remember every detail of all of them, the bits and pieces you do retain will help in the future when working on a project that does use them. Beyond that these topics will fill your "toolbox" with concepts you may not have learned otherwise which can be applied elsewhere when the time is right. Reviewing the topics will broaden your perspective and help you see the bigger picture and how everything fits together. If nothing else you may find a particular topic very interesting and fun and decide to pursue it over the others throughout your career.

## General format

Review a given topic and gather an overview of important points with some basic fundamentals. Then work through larger tutorials to get practical experience. Then build a project using what you've learned, big or small. Just do something you're interested in. Then rinse and repeat for another topic. Larger projects will incorporate several topics together. Such as building a personal website which would encompass full-stack web development, for example, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibility, server-side code, SQL, and design.

Also, it's a good idea to write about what you're learning and doing with blog posts and/or other media. Others will be able to learn from you and you will later be able to look back on all that you've learned and see progress as you gain a deeper understanding.

## Apprenticeship Projects

Here is a list of some of the project assignments which 8th Light (a prominent company focused on clean code and apprenticeships) uses during their apprenticeship program.  

* Tic Tac Toe using minimax  
  * Use TDD  
  * Use SOLID principles  
  * Blog about experience  

* Java Server using CobSpec  
  * Completed once acceptance tests pass, located here: https://github.com/8thlight/cob_spec  
  
* Real consulting project  
  * Build a tool for a non-profit

Here are some other ideas to get more practice and experience.

* Personal Projects
